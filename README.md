## My Second Project with HTML and CSS

this is my second project with HTML and CSS, that i got the idea from [W3.CSS Templates.](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)

I have used **css grid** here and it is obviously not responsive as I was not familiar with responsive concepts then,
and I didn't copy or get help from the original project code.
